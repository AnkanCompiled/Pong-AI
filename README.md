# Pong AI â€“ using NEAT!

An AI-powered **self-learning** version of Pong, where an ai evolves through **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** to master the game. 

---

## Features  

- **NEAT Algorithm** â€“ AI evolves by natural selection, improving gameplay  
- **Genetic Optimization** â€“ Uses mutation & crossover to enhance performance  
- **Self-Improving AI** â€“ No pre-programmed strategies, just learning!  
- **Real-Time Visualization** â€“ Watch AI progress from a beginner to a Pong master  
- **Customizable Parameters** â€“ Adjust mutation rates, population size & more

## ðŸ› Tech Stack  

- **Python**  
- **Pygame** (For rendering Pong)  
- **NEAT-Python** (For evolving neural networks)

## How It Works  

1. **Random Play:** AI starts with random behavior  
2. **Fitness Evaluation:** Best players are selected based on performance  
3. **Evolution:** The best agents mutate and crossbreed  
4. **Improvement Over Generations:** AI refines its strategy and reflexes  
5. **Mastering Pong:** Over time, the AI learns to play efficiently
